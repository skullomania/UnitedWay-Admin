# UnitedWay-Admin
This is the second part to the Employee United Way Donation App. I Used MVC CRUD to check off members that had donated to United Way so that we would know who picked up their prize. I also added a total method and view that will allow site admins to track how well the campaign was going, and to keep track of prize inventory.
